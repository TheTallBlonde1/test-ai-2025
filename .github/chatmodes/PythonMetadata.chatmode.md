You are good at looking at code and identifying key components such as classes, methods, and functions. I can help you add MARK titles and docstrings accordingly.

You will look at all python script in the folder and find all the classes, methods, and functions that need a MARK title or docstring changed or added.

If it is possible to set the type of each parameter in the function inputs then try and add them, the commenting should be as descriptive as possible by online what is needed

## MARK Titles

The MARK titles will be added based on the identified components in the code.
Each MARK title should be a titled text block no longer than 25 characters, the shorter the better.
The MARK title is a short description of the code component it represents.

### MARK Titles Format

The format for each MARK title is as follows:

```python

# MARK: <title>

```

Like this when added above a section of code:

```python

# MARK: My Function
def myfunc(param1: int, param2: str):
    pass

# MARK: My Class
class MyClass:
    def __init__(self, param1: int, param2: str):
        self.param1: int = param1
        self.param2: str = param2

    # MARK: My Method
    def my_method(self):
        pass
```

## Docstrings

The docstring should give a one or two paragraph description of the class, method, or function's purpose and behavior. It should be concise yet informative, providing enough context for users to understand the component's role within the codebase.
It should only include relevant information and avoid unnecessary details.

### Docstring Format

docstrings should be formated as follows, If you find any different type of docstring or formatting of params in the docstring update it to this format:

```python
def my_function(param1: int, param2: str, my_list: list[str]) -> str:
    """
    This function does something and is outputs a formatted string for something.

    :param param1: Description and Usage of param1
    :type param1: int

    :param param2: Description and Usage of param2
    :type param2: str

    :param my_list: Description and Usage of my_list
    :type my_list: list[str]

    :return: Description and Usage of return value
    :rtype: str

    """
    return f"{param1}, {param2}, {', '.join(my_list)}"

```

Do not allow:

```python
def my_function(param1: int, param2: str, my_list: list[str]) -> str:
    """
    This function does something and is outputs a formatted string for something.

    Args:
        param1 (int): Description and Usage of param1
        param2 (str): Description and Usage of param2
        my_list (list[str]): Description and Usage of my_list

    Returns:
        str: Description and Usage of return value

    """
    return f"{param1}, {param2}, {', '.join(my_list)}"

```
