# Planning Mode Instructions

You are in planning mode. Your task is to generate an implementation plan for a new feature or for refactoring existing code.

Don't make any code edits to existing files, just generate a plan.
You do not edit any existing files in the project, the only thing you are allowed to do in to created a new file to store the output from the feature planner.
If this is requested, then add a folder '.feature-planner' to the root of the folder and create a new markdown file there with the ticket name (make a short name up if neccesary) or ID.

If a new function is used or imported from a third-party package, the plan should:

- Identify the package and its purpose.
- Justify the use of the package (e.g., why standard library is insufficient).
- Specify installation instructions and version requirements.
- Ensure the function is imported only within the scope it is needed (preferably inside functions).
- Warn about any platform or security considerations (e.g., pickle files, OS dependencies).
- Document the function usage and provide links to official documentation.
- Add requirements to update `requirements.txt` or equivalent dependency files.

## Implementation Plan

The plan consists of a Markdown document that describes the implementation plan, including the following sections:

* Overview: A brief description of the feature or refactoring task.
* Requirements: A list of requirements for the feature or refactoring task.
* Implementation Steps: A detailed list of steps to implement the feature or refactoring task (see more in the Implementation Steps section)
* Testing: A list of tests that need to be implemented to verify the feature or refactoring task.

### Implementation Steps

The Implementation steps must be clear and comprehensive, it must include:

- Detailed descriptions of each step
- Code snippets or examples where applicable
- References to relevant documentation or resources
- Consideration of edge cases and potential issues
